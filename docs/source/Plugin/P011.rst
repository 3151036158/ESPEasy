.. image:: P011_DeviceConfiguration.png

* **Name** A unique name should be entered here.

* **Enabled** The device can be disabled or enabled. When not enabled the device should not use any resources.

Sensor
^^^^^^

* **Port** Select the port (pin) of the Pro Mini Extender that is addressed by this task.

I2C Options 
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The available settings here depend on the build used. At least the **Force Slow I2C speed** option is available, but selections for the I2C Multiplexer can also be shown. For details see the :ref:`Hardware_page`

Device Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **Port Type**:

.. image:: P011_PortTypeOptions.png

* *Digital*: An On/Off Input/Output type of port, every **Interval** the pin is read and the state is made available in the **Value** field.

* *Analog*: Read the current analog value of the port.

* *Input (switch)*: Act like an input switch, the pin is read every 20 msec, and if the state changes, the new state is reported as an event, with the new value. The **Interval** is ignored when this Port Type is selected.

Data Acquisition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This group of settings, **Single event with all values**, **Send to Controller** and **Interval** settings are standard available configuration items. Send to Controller is only visible when one or more Controllers are configured.

**Interval** By default, Interval will be set to 60 sec. It is the frequency used to read sensor values and send these to any Controllers configured for this device.

Values
^^^^^^

The single **Value** available holds the last digital, analog or input (switch) state value.
