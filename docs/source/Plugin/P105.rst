Description
-----------

The AHT10 sensor provides Temperature and Humidity measurements, via an I2C bus connection.

.. warning::
  There are a few peculiarities with this sensor:

  * The measured values may be not very accurate
  * The device does sometimes not 'play nice' when there are also other I2C devices on the same bus (many complaints can be found on the internet). NB: This may be hardware-, vendor-, or chip-revision-specific.

Because of these peculiarities, other sensors may be more appropriate, like :ref:`P028_page`, :ref:`P106_page`, :ref:`P014_page`, :ref:`P034_page`, :ref:`P051_page`, :ref:`P068_page` or :ref:`P072_page`.

Settings
--------

.. image:: P105_DeviceConfiguration.png

**Name**: The name for this task, should be unique.

**Enabled**: Allows to enable/disable the device.

I2C Options 
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The available settings here depend on the build used. At least the **Force Slow I2C speed** option is available, but selections for the I2C Multiplexer can also be shown. For details see the :ref:`Hardware_page`

**I2C Address**: The address the device is using. The sensor allows to select a secondary address by pulling the AO (sometimes marked as A0) pin to high (3.3V) to select the secondary address. That address should then be selected here too.

Device Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If other devices configured in a task use the I2C bus, a warning is displayed (see example below) that combining them with this device may cause issues on the I2C bus, resulting in all I2C devices no longer working as intended. This may occur immediately, or only after some time, like 10 minutes or an hour.

Data Acquisition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This group of settings, **Single event with all values**, **Send to Controller** and **Interval** settings are standard available configuration items. Send to Controller is only visible when one or more Controllers are configured.

**Interval** By default, Interval will be set to 60 sec.

Values
^^^^^^

The names for the values are initially set to a default name, but can be changed if desired. Also, a formula can be entered to re-calculate, and the number of decimals can be changed, for Temperature, usually 1 decimal is enough to be displayed (value will be rounded).
