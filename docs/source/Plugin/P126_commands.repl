    | ``74hc595Set,<pin>,<0|1>``
    ","
    | Set ``<pin>`` to the state provided. Pin numbers start at 1 and continue up to no. of chips * 8. The shift registers are updated immediately
    "
    "
    | ``74hc595SetNoUpdate,<pin>,<0|1>``
    ","
    | Set ``<pin>`` to the state provided. Pin numbers start at 1 and continue up to no. of chips * 8. The shift registers are **not** updated. See ``74hc595Update`` command.
    "
    "
    | ``74hc595Update``
    ","
    | Update the current buffered state to the shift registers.
    "
    "
    | ``74hc595SetAll,[chip:][width:]<value>...``
    ","
    | Set the addressed chip(s) with the value provided. Values should be max. 32 bit. Chip starts at 1 by default, and width is 4 by default. Shift registers are updated immediately.
    
    | To select a single chip with 8 bits of data, use a ``width`` of 1, use 2 for updating 2 adjacent chips with a 16 bit value, etc.
    "
    "
    | ``74hc595SetAllNoUpdate,[chip:][width:]<value>...``
    ","
    | See ``74hc595SetAll`` command, but without immediate update to the shift registers. See ``74hc595Update`` command to set the output to the shift registers.

    | Switch all shift register outputs to on (high). Immediately updates the shioft registers.
    "

    ","
    | Change the number of chips configured. Will adjust the configuration immediately, but not store the setting, use the ``save`` command for storing the setting.
    
    | When adding chips, the outputs will all be set to low/off.
    "
    "
